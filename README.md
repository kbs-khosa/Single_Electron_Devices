# Single_Electron_Devices (SEDs)
# When the size of the transistor is decreased beyond a limit (about 14nm), quantum effects come into picture and hence fabrication of the transistors becomes difficult.
# In order to manufacture smaller transistors, quantum effect like discrete nature of tunneling electrons is made use of in the form of SEDs.
# The report explained the processes involved in the SEDs and various devices manufactured using SEDs.
# The final sections of the report also discussed the advantages, disadvantages as well as the applications of the SEDs.
